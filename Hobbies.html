		<h2><b><u>Music</u></b></h2>
		
		<br>
		
		<p>One of my main Hobbies is obviously music, I have had an interest in music since a very young age and even before I began to 			play Bass Guitar, I tried my hand at learning how to use Music Production software to create my own music. If it had not been for 		one of my friends encouraging me to learn, I’d likely still be bound to just digital means of music production. To begin learning 		Guitar, I had sold my PS4 and all of my peripherals to afford a Bass guitar and a graphics card to fully commit to my hobbies and 		I don’t regret that decision to this day. Currently, I'm still pracicing guitar and continually trying to learn more about digital 		production. I'd also like to try my hand at other instruments such as drums and piano in the future as generally I really enjoy 			learning new instruments.</p>

	<!this is so dumb, I don't know why the div goes behind the other div without this and this is the only way I can find to fix this. It 		doesn't even do it on the div below it so it has to be something to do with the image or float property on the div above it.>

	<!I don't know if the display being set to  block is necessary here but at the very least it should help with formatting on mobile because 	the line breaks are the only thing other than this ensuring the divs are set in the right places and I imagine they'll change when on 		mobile.>
	<div class="header" style="display: block;">
	
		<h2><b><u>Computing</b></u></h2>
		
		<br>
		
		<p>Like most people, I developed an interest in computing due to my love of video games and really began to become interested 			during my IT lessons in primary school, where we learned the basics of making games in Scratch, a block based programming service 		designed to make it easy for children to create games. Since then, I began to learn more about it on my own, through enjoying 			making games through scratch and aspiring to build my own computer. Due to this, I took Computer Science at GCSE, and despite 			never receiving my qualification, I believe I learned a lot of valuable things during the time I attended secondary school. In 			2019, I built my first computer, something I had been aspiring to do for many years before and since then I have taken a Level 3 			computing course to help me potentially turn this hobby into a career path.</p>

		<h2><b><u>Literature</u></b></h2>
		
		<br>
		
		<p>I have also developed an interest in reading and general literature in recent years. I began reading with things like the Percy 		Jackson books and other things similar when I was young, however since I was in the top set for English, during the lessons we 			would read works like Inspector Calls and The Crucible. After that, I began to read works like Jane Eyre and Norwegian Wood. Since 		then, I have been enjoying works by people like Haruki Murakami and Soren Kierkegaard. Last year, I entered a writing competition 		and almost received an honourable mention for the piece that I wrote and I wish to enter more of these competitions in the 		future.</p>
