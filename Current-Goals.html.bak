		<h2>Computing</h2>
		<p>My main goal for computing at the moment is to complete the Level 3 general computing course I’m on at the moment and progress 		onto a more specialised computing course next year. My options for this would likely be to do either Level 3 Cyber-Security or 			Level 3 App Development. Past this, I’d like to go to university for whatever I decide to do next year and find a way to study 			abroad in Japan while at university. To help with achieving this I’ve been trying to obtain an N5 Japanese language qualification, 		and I am growing quite close to this at the moment.</p>

		<h2>Music</h2>
		<p>As for my goals with music, I wish to continue learning digital music production and continue practising Guitar and Bass. This 		year, I hope to achieve Grade 8 Guitar and Grade 6 Bass, as grades 7, 8 and 9 all provide 30 UCAS points, as well as being 		something I’d want to achieve regardless. In the future, I would also like to try my hand at learning piano and drums, as although 		it’s a big commitment, I genuinely really enjoy just learning new instruments.</p>
